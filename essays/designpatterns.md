Before this semester, I was honestly scared to learn Javascript because someone had once told me how hard it was for them to learn. I now can say I think the opposite. Learning the basics of Javascript were not only easy but it was very enjoyable. 

I’m a big fan of the slightly simpler syntax than what I am used to. In the first week of this class, I feel like I now have an understanding of Javascript. I also have a much better understanding of objects now. My favorite thing about Javascript so far is being able to return any data type from a function and not only the data type of the parameter to the function like in Java. 


I found that the WODs so far have been very useful. I think it’s a good way to be motivated about problems that actually put to use of skill and understanding of programming. It is stressful for me but I have been enjoying it. Our first class WOD for points I was not able to finish. This was a huge bummer and ruined my day. Thinking about it after, I had the exact solution that was shown as an example after the WOD was over and beating myself up for not finishing because of syntax issues and forgetting to change a number was not worth it. I solved the problem immediately in my head and will strive to work on my actual execution in coding. I hope this works for me.
