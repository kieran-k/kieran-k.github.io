I co-lead the testing and implentation of 1/3 of large scale company wide project. This application affects all departments and daily functions. Testing included the creation of over 2000 thousand testcases that included, step by step insturctions, expected results, assigned tester, linking to requriment being tested and JIRA listing. Testing also included, opening bugs and defects,addressing hardware issues with tech support, working with the Vendors to correct errors, changing existing policy/proceuders and working with multiple departments to ensure a smooth transtion. 

```js
byte ADCRead(byte ch)
{
    word value;
    ADC1SC1 = ch;
    while (ADC1SC1_COCO != 1)
    {   // wait until ADC conversion is completed   
    }
    return ADC1RL;  // lower 8-bit value out of 10-bit data from the ADC
}
```
