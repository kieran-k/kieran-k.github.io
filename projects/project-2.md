<img class="ui medium right floated rounded image" src="../images/twitter bot screenshot.png">
As my first personal project, I decided to create a Twitter bot for my own personal use. This project was my first experience using python.

This is a simple twitter bot that is able to like, follow and retweet. Main use of this bot is to pull information from the users main account. 
The bot will pull the "Likes" of a user and retweet them. Purpose for this is to have a seperate account to show interests that might not suit main account tweets. 

This bot is written in the python programming language and uses the python library Tweepy to access the Twitter API, tweepy wraps the Twitter API for use with python. 

Source Code : coming soon
