I co-lead the testing and implentation of a large scale company wide project. This project was the development and implementation of a new application that affects all departments and daily functions.

Testing included the creation of over 3000 thousand testcases in accordance to the Software Development Dife Cycle. Testcases included step by step insturctions, expected results, assigned tester, linking to requriment being tested and JIRA listing. Testing also included, opening bugs and defects, addressing hardware issues with tech support, working with the Vendors to correct errors, changing existing policy/procedures and working with multiple departments to ensure a smooth transtion. 

Worked through many challenges such as, meeting deadline requirements, obtaining technical solutions for applications from both internal IT departments and external developers and analysts. Reporting and escalating issues to workstream leads and upper management.
